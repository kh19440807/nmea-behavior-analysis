# GNSS NMEA Behavior Analysis (Experimental Prototype)

This repository contains an experimental, non-commercial research prototype for analyzing GNSS behavior from offline NMEA logs.

The purpose of this project is technical exploration and validation, focusing on whether machine-learning-based approaches can distinguish spoofed vs. unspoofed GNSS behavior in scenarios where traditional rule-based checks are insufficient. The focus is on post-event analysis rather than operational detection.

## Key Characteristics
- Offline analysis of recorded NMEA logs
- ML models trained and evaluated using the public MARSIM maritime spoofing dataset
- Comparison between:
  - traditional rule-based anomaly indicators
  - statistical / machine-learning-based classification
- Visualization of:
  - GNSS signal quality (C/N₀)
  - velocity behavior
  - reconstructed position tracks

## Non-goals
- Real-time detection
- Operational deployment
- Production or safety-critical use
- Commercial services or products

## Data Sources
- Publicly available [MARSIM dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/8202802)
- No proprietary, confidential, or employer-owned data is used
